passage="""Narendra Modi is the 14th and current Prime Minister of India,
having assumed office in May 2014. Born on September 17, 1950, in 
Vadnagar, Gujarat, Modi's rise to power is a remarkable story of 
political determination and strategic vision. Prior to becoming Prime 
Minister, he served as the Chief Minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014, 
where he was credited with driving significant economic growth in the 
state but also faced criticism for his handling of the 2002 Gujarat 
riots. As Prime Minister, Modi has pursued ambitious policies like the 
"Make in India" initiative, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) 
implementation, and the Swachh Bharat mission. His government has focused on 
modernization, digital infrastructure, and strengthening India's 
position on the global stage. Modi remains a polarizing figure,
admired for his leadership and criticized for his approach to 
issues like religious tolerance and governance."""
